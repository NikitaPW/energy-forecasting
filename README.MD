# ⚡ Energy Consumption Forecasting – Time Series ML Project

This project tackles a common problem in the energy sector: forecasting electricity consumption using historical usage data. Accurate forecasts help utilities manage supply and demand more effectively, reduce costs, and identify consumption anomalies early.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The objective is to predict future energy usage based on historical consumption patterns. This is a **time series regression** problem, requiring specialized data handling and temporal feature engineering.

Key challenges include:
- Capturing temporal dependencies
- Engineering meaningful lag/rolling features
- Avoiding data leakage from the future
- Handling seasonality and trend
